This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(readr)
library(stringr)
library(lubridate)
TyphoonData <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaryLKL/course-programming-for-ds-Quiz/master/TyphoonData.csv", col_types = cols(.default = col_character()))
Year <- TyphoonData$年份
Year <- as.integer(Year)-1911
Year <- as.character(Year)
str_c("民國", SEP= Year,"年")

```

```{r}
library(readr)
library(stringr)
TyphoonData <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaryLKL/course-programming-for-ds-Quiz/master/TyphoonData.csv", col_types = cols(.default = col_character()))
Time <- TyphoonData$發布警報時間
str_sub(Time, 6, 7)
table(str_sub(Time, 6, 7))



```
```{r}
?table
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
